-   **In-Depth Performance Analysis**: Provides a detailed breakdown of the user's performance, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and skill gaps.
-   **Custom Career Roadmaps**: Leverages the Google Gemini API to generate a comprehensive, step-by-step career roadmap tailored to the user's chosen tech field and skill level.

    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the following variables. These are essential for the application to function correctly.
